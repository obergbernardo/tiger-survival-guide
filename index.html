  <h1>How to Survive in a Boat with a Bengal Tiger</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Method 1: Avoid Getting Into This Boat Trip in the First Place</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Don’t go on boat trips with wild animals. Tigers don’t belong on boats. Resist the temptation. Don’t click sketchy links. If someone invites you, say you have a tennis tournament. It always works.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you're already in a boat with a tiger and it’s sinking—pause. Think. Land away from the tiger, ideally near food and shelter. Snacks = survival.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="situation">Situation One: You Landed Right Next to the Tiger</div>
    <p>Congrats! You messed up your physics and wish you’d paid attention in Grade 6 trigonometry instead of playing Brawl Stars. You’re face-to-face with a hungry tiger. This guide can't help you anymore. Accept your fate peacefully.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="situation">Situation Two: You Landed Away from the Tiger but Far from Food and Shelter</div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Build a raft using buoys and ropes. Don’t know how? Too bad. Every human should know this.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Push the raft at least 150 meters away. Tigers jump far.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pull out your phone, turn on TELUS mobile data, close Brawl Stars, and call 911. Yes, they handle tiger-boat situations now.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait. And try not to think about the tiger. Good luck.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="situation">Situation Three: You Landed Near the Food and Shelter, but the Tiger Didn’t</div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Toss the food off the boat. Tigers are not geniuses—they’ll go after it.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Swim around and push the boat toward safety with your legs.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Realize you’re freezing in the Pacific. Hypothermia kicks in. If you’re gym-strong, maybe you climb back in. But you’ll probably still freeze. At least you read this guide!</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If someone invites you to a boat trip, say no. Immediately.</li>
      <li>Don’t try to pet the tiger. It’s not your cat, Cookie.</li>
      <li>Use your massive brain (and some physics) to land in the right spot.</li>
      <li>Survival odds are low, but now you’re semi-prepared.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    Good luck! You’re gonna need it.
