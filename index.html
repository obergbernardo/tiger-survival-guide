  <h1>How to Survive in a Boat with a Bengal Tiger</h1>

  <h2>Method 1: Avoid Getting Into This Boat Trip in the First Place</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Don‚Äôt go on boat trips with wild animals. Tigers don‚Äôt belong on boats, and you don‚Äôt want to be stuck with one if the boat sinks.</li>
    <li>Therefore avoid all temptations to go on this trip, don‚Äôt click on links that provide access to these trips. The internet is also a dangerous place. And in case someone invites you, decline it. If you don‚Äôt want the person to feel bad say that you had a tennis tournament scheduled for that period of time, it always works!</li>
    <li>If you‚Äôre on a boat that has wild animals and it starts sinking, and you see the tiger jumping with you into the lifeboat, stop everything you‚Äôre doing and pause for a moment. Look around, think calmly, and try to land somewhere away from the tiger. Bonus points if you land near the food and shelter area on the lifeboat, because survival is based on having snacks and a roof over your head.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Method 2</h2>
  <p>Try to avoid going into boat trips that contain wild animals, like a tiger for example, there is a small chance that the boat will sink and you get stuck with a tiger that jumped in it with you<br />
  If you end up in a trip with wild animals and your boat is sinking, as you jump to the lifeboat and you see the tiger jumping as well, assess your surroundings, calculate where on the boat you‚Äôre going to fall and project your energy into moving your body there, try to fall in a place away from the tiger, it will be even better if you fall into the resources area of the boat, which contain shelter and food, so make sure you study all the lifeboats around your boat if you ever go in an ocean trip!</p>

  <h2>Situation one: You fell close to the tiger, you ended up doing the wrong calculations mid-air and now you‚Äôre face to face with the beast, now you‚Äôre thinking that you should‚Äôve paid attention to your grade 6 math class! Peacefully accept your fate, there is nothing that we could say on this website that would save you from that situation.</h2>

  <h2>Situation two: You fell away from the tiger but away from the resources, now you have a small chance of the tiger not eating you, but you can still die by other things.</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Collect all the buoys around the boat with some ropes, create a raft, this is very easy, but we‚Äôre not going to teach you how to create the raft, this is something everyone should already know how to do.</li>
    <li>Now you have isolated yourself momentarily from the tiger, tigers are known for jumping far away, so make sure there is a distance of at least 50 meters from the boat.</li>
    <li>Pick up your phone which hasn‚Äôt gotten wet from the sinking and call the local authorities, their phone number is 911, they will pick you up soon.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Step 4: Wait.</h2>

  <h2>Situation Three: You fell in the resources area and the tiger fell away from you, you‚Äôre unlucky, the tiger will smell the food and go towards you.</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Throw all the food out of the boat, the tiger is not very smart, so it will jump in the water to get the food.</li>
    <li>As soon as the tiger jumps, go around the boat and push it while you swim with your legs, it is going to make the boat go faster and you will soon reach an island.</li>
    <li>When you realize 20 seconds later of what you have done it is already late, the pacific ocean has temperatures below the human‚Äôs, so your body will freeze and you will drown, if during your life time you have been going to the gym, you will be able to hold yourself and do a pull up to climb the boat, but you‚Äôre going to die from hypothermia anyways, so just be grateful for having read this wikihow, without it you would probably be dead by now.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If someone invites you to go on a boat trip, decline it immediately.</li>
    <li>If you‚Äôre stuck with a Bengal Tiger, don‚Äôt try to pet it, they‚Äôre a little more dangerous than your cute cat Cookie.</li>
    <li>Use your enormous brain (and basic physics) to fall in the right spot.</li>
    <li>Survival chances are slim, but now you‚Äôre prepared in case this situation happens with you.</li>
    <li>Good luck! You‚Äôre gonna need it.</li>
  </ul>
