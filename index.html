  <h1>How to Survive in a Boat with a Bengal Tiger</h1>

  <h2>Method 1: Avoid Getting Into This Boat Trip in the First Place</h2>

  <div class="step">
    <strong>Step 1:</strong> Don‚Äôt go on boat trips with wild animals. Tigers don‚Äôt belong on boats, and you don‚Äôt want to be stuck with one if the boat sinks.
    <br><br>
    Therefore avoid all temptations to go on this trip, don‚Äôt click on links that provide access to these trips. The internet is also a dangerous place. And in case someone invites you, decline it. If you don‚Äôt want the person to feel bad say that you had a tennis tournament scheduled for that period of time, it always works!
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <strong>Step 2:</strong> If you‚Äôre on a boat that has wild animals and it starts sinking, and you see the tiger jumping with you into the lifeboat, stop everything you‚Äôre doing and pause for a moment. Look around, think calmly, and try to land somewhere away from the tiger. Bonus points if you land near the food and shelter area on the lifeboat, because survival is based on having snacks and a roof over your head.
  </div>

  <div class="situation">
    <h3>Situation One: You Landed Right Next to the Tiger</h3>
    Congratulations, you messed up your physics and math mid-air, you wish you had paid more attention to your grade 6 trigonometric class instead of playing Brawl Stars, and now you‚Äôre face-to-face with a big, hungry Bengal tiger. There‚Äôs not much this guide can do for you now, so just breathe deep and peacefully accept your fate.
  </div>

  <div class="situation">
    <h3>Situation Two: You Landed Away from the Tiger but Far from Food and Shelter</h3>
    <strong>Step 1:</strong> Collect all the buoys and ropes you can find and build yourself a raft. If you don‚Äôt already know how to do this, it‚Äôs not ok, we‚Äôre not going to help you because that‚Äôs something every human is supposed to know. Poor you.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Step 2:</strong> Push your raft at least 150 meters away from the boat ‚Äî because tigers are good jumpers, and you want to keep that distance.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Step 3:</strong> Now that you are far away from the tiger, pull out your phone, turn on the TELUS mobile internet, close the Brawl Stars app and open the Telephone app and call 911, this is the best option to do in this situation, police-officers are well-trained for all situations, even when a ship is sinking on the pacific ocean and there isn‚Äôt any land in 50 km nearby.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait. And try not to think too much about that tiger. Help will arrive soon.
  </div>

  <div class="situation">
    <h3>Situation Three: You Landed Near the Food and Shelter, but the Tiger Didn‚Äôt</h3>
    The tiger smells the food and is heading your way. Why did you not think about this while landing?
    <br><br>
    <strong>Step 1:</strong> Toss all the food off the boat. Tigers aren‚Äôt as smart as humans like you‚Äîthey‚Äôll jump into the water to chase it.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Step 2:</strong> While the tiger‚Äôs busy swimming after your snacks, swim around the boat and use your legs to push it faster toward safety.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Step 3:</strong> Twenty seconds later, you realize the Pacific Ocean is freezing cold. You‚Äôre going to get hypothermia. If you‚Äôve been hitting the gym, you might have the strength to pull yourself back onto the boat ‚Äî but sorry, you‚Äôll probably still freeze. So hey, at least you read this WikiHow before dying!
  </div>

  <div class="final">
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    If someone invites you to go on a boat trip, decline it immediately.
    <br><br>
    If you‚Äôre stuck with a Bengal Tiger, don‚Äôt try to pet it, they‚Äôre a little more dangerous than your cute cat Cookie.
    <br><br>
    Use your enormous brain (and basic physics) to fall in the right spot.
    <br><br>
    Survival chances are slim, but now you‚Äôre prepared in case this situation happens with you.
    <br><br>
    Good luck! You‚Äôre gonna need it.
